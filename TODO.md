# TODO
 * ActionChain run code in monitors Run() seems to be the same for every monitor, consider moving it to it's own package
 * Add some string validations in the config schema (phone numbers, e-mails, URLs)
 * Build system. Build on the Mac to run on CentOS 5: sudo GOOS=linux GOARCH=386 GOPATH=/Users/andre/Dev/go go install github.com/andmar/fraudion
